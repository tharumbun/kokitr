11ty (also known as eleventy) is a static site generator that is designed to be simple and powerful. It is written in JavaScript and uses a template language called Nunjucks. [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) is a great option for developers who want to create static websites without the hassle of a traditional CMS.

11ty is a great framework for creating blogs. It is a simplified take on static site generators and gives you the basic tools that you need to create a blog. It does not force you to use any particular templating language, so you can still use Liquid if you want to port a Jekyll site over to 11ty. It is also completely secure and has lightning-fast page loads. However, it does not have a WYSIWYG editor.

| Template language | Markdown, Handlebars, Liquid | React |
| Router | N/A | Built-in |
| Image optimizer | N/A | Built-in |
| Plugin ecosystem | Large | Small |
| Learning curve | Steep | Gentle |
| Best for | Sites that need to be highly flexible or sites that need to be built quickly | Sites that need to be fast and efficient |
